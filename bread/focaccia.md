# Focaccia

## Ingredients

- 400g strong white bread flour (300W strength)
- 320ml cold water
- 7g dried yeast
- 1 tablespoon golden caster sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Extra virgin olive oil

Garnish

- Fresh rosemary
- Pinch sea salt


## Prep - Stage 1
- Add the cold water, yeast and sugar to a large bowl and gently mix, leave for a few minutes
- Gradually add the flour to the bowl, stiring with a spoon as you go to incorporate it
- Throughly mix this to create a wet dough
- Cover and leave this for around 30 minutes

## Stage 2

- Using a large spoon, scrape the dough away from the side and fold over the top. Keep doing this - you want to turn the bowl with one hand and fold with the other. You only need to do this for a few minutes until we start to get a good amount of air into the dough (the surface should start to tighten up a bit).
Leave this now for one hour to rise.

## Stage 3

- Thoroughly oil your hands and gently separate the dough from the sides of the bowl. Once it's coming loose, you want to lift the whole thing gently in one go so that it folds on itself. You want to VERY gently work it into a ball (without knocking the air out).
- At this point you want to place it in the tray and let it rest again for about 45 minutes
- You may want to use a little grease-proof paper on the bottom to aid in getting this out once cooked, depending on how difficult your tray makes that process!

## Stage 4

- The dough should now have expanded to fill quite a bit more of the tray. Use your hands to gently press and move the dough around to fill the tray edge-to-edge. Sprinkle over with the chopped fresh rosemary and gently press down into the dough with your fingertips. This gives the focaccia it's traditional bumpy surfaced look.  Drizzle liberally with olive oil and sprinkle with some sea salt.

## Cooking

- The tray goes in a 220 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Keep an eye on it from the 15 minute mark, you want the top to be nicely dark brown, but not burned
- Remove to a wire rack and allow to cool
