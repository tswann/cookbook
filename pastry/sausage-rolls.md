## Ingredients

### Filling

- 450g pack of pork sausages
- 1/2 onion finely chopped
- 8 cream crackers - fine crumbs
- 2 slices of bread - fine crumbs
- 1 teaspoon mixed herbs
- 1 teaspoon fennel seeds

### Sausage rolls

- Make the [Flakey Pastry](flakey-pastry.md)
- plain flour (for dusting)
- 1 large egg, beaten (for brushing)

## Preparation

1. Heat the some oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat, then add the onion and cook until softened.

2. When the onion is cooled, add the sausage meat, cracker and bread crumbs, herbs and some salt and pepper. Mix well.

3. Divide the pastry block in half. Roll one half out on a lightly floured surface into a large rectangle.

4. Shape one half of the sausage filling into a log down the middle of the pastry, but slightly off to the side nearest you. Brush the far edge with a little egg wash. Wrap the pastry from the near side over the filling to enclose it, roll and press the outer edge to seal it.

5. Repeat with the other piece of pastry and the remainder of the filling. Place both pastry rolls in the fridge for an hour to rest and firm up.

6. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking parchment.

7. Take the pastry rolls out of the fridge, cut each one into as many even lengths as you like, and place on the lined tray. Brush with beaten egg. Then make two fine slits with a sharp knife in the top of each roll (or cut a snip with scissors) Bake for 30â€“35 minutes, or until golden-brown.
