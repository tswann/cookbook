# Sausage Rolls

## Ingredients

### Filling

- 450g pack of pork sausages
- 400g tin of green lentils
- 1 courgette grated
- 1 carrot grated
- 1/2 onion finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
- 1 teaspoon dried sage
- salt + pepper

### Sausage rolls

- 500g block shortcrust pastry
- plain flour for dusting
- 1 large egg, beaten

## Preparation

1. Heat the some oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat, then add the onion and cook until softened.

2. Squeeze the courgette in your hands to remove as much excess liquid as you can, then add to the pan with the carrot, garlic, dried sage and fennel seeds. Cook for a further 5 minutes, stirring often. Tip into a large bowl and leave it to cool completely.

3. When the veg mixture is cooled, add the sausage meat, lentils and some salt and pepper. Mix well.

4. Divide the pastry block in half. Roll one half out on a lightly floured surface into a large rectangle.

5. Shape one half of the sausage filling into a log down the middle of the pastry, but slightly off to the side nearest you. Brush the far edge with a little egg wash. Fold the pastry from the near side over the filling to enclose it and press the edges together to seal. Flip it onto its side so the edges are facing up and further press them together to make sure its well-sealed.

4. Repeat with the other piece of pastry and the remainder of the filling. Place both pastry rolls in the fridge for an hour to rest and firm up.

5. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking parchment.

6. Take the pastry rolls out of the fridge, cut each one into as many even lengths as you like, and place on the lined tray. Brush with beaten egg. Then make two fine slits with a sharp knife in te top of each roll. Bake for 30â€“35 minutes, or until golden-brown.
