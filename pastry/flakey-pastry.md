# Flakey Pastry

## Ingredients

- 250g block of Golden Cow butter, frozen
- 400g plain flour
- 200ml ice cold water
- 1 tsp English mustard powder
- 1 tbsp cider or white wine vinegar
- Pinch of salt

## Prep (beforehand)

- Freeze the block of butter the night before making the pastry
- Before making the pastry put 200ml of water in the fridge for around an hour to chill it

## Prep
- Add the flour, mustard powder and a pinch of salt to a large glass bowl
- Hold the butter block in it's wrapping and coarsely grate the butter into the pastry
- Add the vinegar and watter to the bowl and bring it together gently with a cutley knife
- You don't want to over-work it, just bring it together
- Wrap in cling-film and chill for at least 30 mins

## Using for sausage rolls

- Tip the dough onto a floured surface, roll out to a rectangle and trim the edges. 
- Brush the pastry lightly with some egg, then mould the sausage mixture into a roll. 
- Sit the sausage just off-centre on the pastry, then fold the pastry over and crimp or use a fork to press the ends together. Slice into pieces using a knife dipped in warm water and wiped clean between slices. 
- Snip the middle of each roll with scissors and brush all over with egg wash
