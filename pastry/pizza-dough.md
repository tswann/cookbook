# Pizza Dough

## Ingredients

- 500g 00 flour (This is the one I use, it's available from Spar and really good: [Wessex Mill](https://wessexmill.co.uk/product/pasta-pizza-flour/))

- Single 7g packet of yeast
- 325ml lukewarm water

## Prep

- Mix the flour, Salt, Yeast, Sugar in a large bowl
- Add the olive oil and water
- Mix and need it in the bowl until it forms a sticky dough
- Tip out onto a floured work surface, kneed for 5 minutes until the dough is elastic and springy
- Clean out the bowl, lightly oil it and return the dough to the bowl
- Cover with a cloth and leave to proove for at least one hour
- When ready to use, tip it out onto a floured work surface and knock the air out of the dough
- Divide it up into 4 and roll out each one into a pizza base as needed
