# Pizza Dough

## Ingredients

- 700g Strong white bread flour
- 200g 00 flour (This is the one I use, it's available from Spar and really good: [Wessex Mill](https://wessexmill.co.uk/product/pasta-pizza-flour/))
- 100g Semolina
- Three tablespoons of Olive Oil
- One tablespoon of golden caster sugar
- Teaspoon of salt
- Single 7g packet of yeast
- 650ml water

## Prep

- Mix the flour, Salt, Yeast, Sugar in a large bowl
- Add the olive oil and water
- Mix and kneed it in the bowl until it forms a sticky dough
- Tip out onto a floured work surface, kneed for 5 minutes until the dough is elastic and springy
- Clean out the bowl, lightly oil it and return the dough to the bowl
- Cover with a cloth and leave to proove for at least one hour
- When ready to divide, tip it out onto a floured work surface and knock the air out of the dough
- I use my hand to pinch off 6 even amounts of dough. The idea is then to form individual dough balls which we will arrange on a large tray and allow to prove, covered with cling film in the fridge for several hours.
- Remove shortly just before you need to use them.
