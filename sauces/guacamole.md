# Guacamole

You can't beat the Guac. I use this to adjust the heat of chilli when I make a batch of it, so I make this HOT. It means I can give the kids the mild chilli and make it spicier for the wife and I by adding some of this on the side.
You can put less chillis in it to have it milder. 

## Ingredients

- Flesh of 2 ripe avocados
- Handful of fresh coriander
- 2 tbsp of olive oil
- As much fresh chilli as you like (I usually remove the seeds)
- Juice of 2 limes
- 2 spring onions, chopped
- half a ripe tomatoe, or 2 cherry tomatoes 
  (optional - I'll throw these in if I have any)

## Prep

- Blend all of the above in a food processor until its the consistency you like
- Add a bit of water if its too thick
