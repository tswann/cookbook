# Tom's Hot Sauce

This is my favourite homemade hot sauce, which I've basically come up with through using ingrediants from Sichuan that I like. 

I love Sichuan spices and this is a heavy dose of both types of dried chilli which are popular in Sichuan cooking and also the Sichuan pepper corns, which are essential.

You can make this with any dried chillis really, but it's going to taste different depending on the variety. 

These are quite rich, citrusy (which I add lemon to bring out a bit more) and a hint of smokiness.

I've linked the exact types that I use below.

Fairly hot, but not overly so! Also makes a great chilli mayo.


## Ingredients

- [Facing Heaven Dried Chillis](https://www.souschef.co.uk/products/sichuan-dried-long-chillies) - a few handfuls
- [Sichuan Long Dried Chillis](https://www.souschef.co.uk/products/long-dried-chilli) - equal amount to above
- Sichuan Pepper Corns - 1 level tablespoon
- 150 ml of apple cider vinegar
- 250 ml of boiling water
- 1 celery stick roughly chopped
- 2 shallots roughly chopped
- 3 garlic cloves roughly chopped
- 1 teapsoon of dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Small bunch of fresh Coriander (Cilantro)

## Steps

1. Step 1 is to decide how hot you want this to be, which comes down to how many seeds you're going to leave in and also the balance of chillis. I've recommended 50/50 for both - but if you add more Long Dried Chillis and more seeds then this will increase the heat.
2. Under a medium heat, toast the chillis and the Sichuan pepper in a dry pan. This only needs a few minutes and you need to watch carefully that things don't start to burn. This is just to toast the chillis and peppercorns and release their oils.
3. Tip in the vinegar followed by the water. All all the ingredients witht he exception of the lemon juice and coriander.
4. This is where we put the lid on the pan and leave it on a low heat for several hours. This is to completely re-hydrate the chillis in the process.
5. Once this process is complete, take the lid off and add in the lemon juice and the coriander. Let it all wilt down into the sauce.
6. Leave the sauce to cool down a bit and then it's time to thoroughly blend it all up. The amount of the liquid you retain at this point is going to determine how thick the final sauce is.
7. Finally pass it through a sieve into a sterile jar for storage.
