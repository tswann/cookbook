# Southern-Fried Chicken

## Ingredients

- 4 Chicken breasts (or equivalent drumsticks etc.)

- 3 tablespoons plain flour
- 1 tablespoon corn flour

- 200ml buttermilk
OR
- 200ml whole milk, 1 teaspoon of vinegar
- shot of vodka
- 2 large egg whites


### Spice Mix

- 1 teaspoon Salt 
- 1 teaspoon Celery salt
- 1 teaspoon Pepper
- 1 dessert spoon Smoked Paprika
- 1 teaspoon mild chilli powder
- 2 dessert spoon Paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon Coleman's mustard powder
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- 2 teaspoons dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano


## Preparation

1. Salt the chicken by placing it flat on a tray and sprinkling over some salt. Set aside whilst making the spice mix (leave for around 30 mins if its just out of the fridge)
2. Combine all the spice mix incredients in a bowl
3. Use half the spice mixture to coat the chicken

## Dredging

1. Use a big bowl to put the buttermilk (or milk + vinegar) into along with the shot of vodka and two egg whites.
   As with soda bread, buttermilk is what you really want here. Use the substitute if you can't get hold of any.
2. Beside it set up a food bag containing the flour mix and remaining half of the spices
3. And finally, beside these set up a wire rack on which to set the dredged chicken.
4. Working with 1 piece of chicken at a time, dip in the buttermilk mixture to completely coat it and then throw it in the bag and shake until completely.
5. Set each piece of chicken onto the wire rack. This step is important - leave it to sit on the rack at room temperature for at least 10 minutes and up to 30 minutes whilst you get the oil heated. The coating should start to rise / puff up.

## Cooking

1. The chicken is best fried in a dutch oven - I use a big cast iron pot. Put in enough oil such that it goes about half-way up the chicken when all the pieces are placed in.
2. I heat the oil over a medium-high heat. It needs to get to the point were a piece of the batter dropped into the oil will bubble and float up the top. Usually takes about 10 mins, but keep an eye on it depending on your hob.
3. Place 3 pieces of the chicken in the oil and fry, using tongs to rotate the pieces every 3 to 4 minutes and adjusting the heat as needed.
4. Transfer the chicken to another rack or baking sheet (lined with kitchen paper). 
5. Let the chicken drain and cool for about 5/10 mins before serving.
