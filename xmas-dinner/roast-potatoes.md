# Roast Potatoes

Like... roast some potatoes.

OK, so use something like Roosters or King Edwards. I cut them into even sized chunks keeping them fairly large and par-boil for 5-10ish minutes, basically until they start to get soft around the edges.

When dropped into a collander and you give them a swish around their edges should be soft enough to rough up a bit.

When they go in the oven (at around 200 degrees C fan) you can put whatever you prefer on them.

Personally, for Xmas dinner I go with duck/goose fat and use rapeseed oil on every other occassion. 

I also like to add garlics cloves, some dried thyme and chopped fresh rosemary. Salt and pepper.

They will take about 25 - 35 minutes depending. Keep checking towards the end.
