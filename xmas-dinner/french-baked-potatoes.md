# French Baked Potatoes

Your chosen cooking dish will determine how much you are going to make.

## Ingredients

- Potatoes (Maris pipers)
- Cheese (Double Gloucester)
- Pouring cream
- Black pepper
- Butter

## Preparation

1. Peel the potatoes, thinly slice, rinse in cold water
2. Dry potatoes thoroughly
3. Grate Cheese

Ingredients are now ready for layering in a large oven-proof dish.

4. Layer of potatoes
5. Layer of grated Cheese
6. Dot with knobs of Butter
7. Cover with a little pouting cream
8. Sprinkle with black pepper

Repeat steps 4 - 8 until all ingredients have been used up.

9. Cover dish with cling-film
10. Place in microwave and cook on high until soft and a fork will pierce the mixture very easily. I put this on for 25 minutes and then check if it needs another 5.
