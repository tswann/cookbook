# Pork & Fennel Meatballs

## Ingredients

### Meatballs

- 12 pork sausages
- 1/2 tsp fennel seeds
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 large egg
- 8 cream crackers
- 30g grated parmesan (plus some for serving)

### Sauce

- 1 large onion
- 1/2 tsp fennel seeds
- 1 tsp mild chilli powder
- 1 tsp dried mixed herbs
- 1 tbsp tomato puree
- 2 tins of chopped tomatoes

- Fresh basil

## Preparation

1. Lightly toast the teaspoon of fennel seeds in a pan on medium heat. Grind to a powder.
2. Remove the sausage meat from the skins and place in a large mixing bowl
3. Blitz the cream crackers into fine crumbs and add to the bowl along with the egg, some black pepper, 1 tsp of oregano and 1/2 of the fennel. Mix this all together thoroughly.
4. Make the sauce by cooking the onion and finely chopped stalks of the basil with some oil and butter in a pan until softened. Add the garlic, herbs, fennel and chilli powder.
5. Add the tomato puree, chopped tomatoes and stock
6. Cook this low and slow until it has reduced well. You can add the peppers at any point depending on how fresh you want them.
7. Stir in the basil leaves just before serving.
8. I take the amount I need and mix with pasta before serving with some grated parmesan. The rest of the sauce can then be frozen.
